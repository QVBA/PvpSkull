# PvpSkull
Minecraft mod to replicate a stripped down version of Runescape's skull system into MC PvP.
Still in development.

TODO:
  Add proper saving over server restarts.
  Add skull icon (or something similar) above skulled players heads.
  Add option for blocking certain commands (such as teleports) to skulled players.
  Add option for skulled players being able to be attacked (but not attack) in safe zones.
  Add configuration option for amount of items unskulled players can save.
  Add hover-over text for saved items in the player inventory.
  Add killstreak tracking for players.
  Add reputation system for killing skulled/unskulled players. (i.e, Protector for people who kill skulled players, Villan for people who kill unskulled players)
